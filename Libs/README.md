# External Libraries Directory

Here you can find included libraries.
Some libraries are modified in a way or another. 
So it's not advised to just replace them when updating.
Try to do folder by folder diff with a tool like WinMerge or Meld.

There are also some libraries that you can or should get on your own.
You can see them below:

## Essential Libraries:
None for now! Yay!   

## Optional Libraries:   
[libogg](https://xiph.org/downloads/ "Xiph libogg") - Vorbis library depends on this. You should rename "libogg-x.x.x" folder as "ogg"   
[libvorbis](https://xiph.org/downloads/ "Xiph libvorbis") - Used for OGG/Vorbis support. You should rename "libvorbis-x.x.x" folder as "vorbis"
